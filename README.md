# Code Execution 

## Figures 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e)

- Run the file `CAEvsP_compare.py` to generate the file `cae_vs_p.mat`.
- Run `CAE_vs_P.m` to obtain Figures 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) respectively.

## Figures 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c)

- Run the file `CAEvsFmax.py` to generate the file `cae_vs_p.mat`.
- Run `CAE_vs_Fmax.m` to obtain Figures 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) respectively.

## Figures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c)

- Run the file `CAEvsPboth.py` to generate the file `CAE_vs_pboth.mat`.
- Run `CAE_vs_pboth.m` to obtain Figures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) respectively.

## Tables II(a) and II(b)

- Run the file `REvsP.py` to generate the file `REvsP.mat`.
- Run `REvsP.m` if figure visualization is required.

## Table III
